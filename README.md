A simple 3D game engine built using raycasting, inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*
This project is part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to explore low-level graphics programming with the MiniLibX library.

The main goals of the project are:
- Parsing a custom format of maps (.cub)
- Implementing a simple raycasting engine
- Creating an interactive window and handling movement and rotation
- Rendering textures and sprites on walls/projected in the 3d space
- Handling collisions

To compile and run this project you can just use make/make bonus to create the binary file used to launch the program, then just pass a map as argument.

And here are a few screenshots to showcase the project:
